                What Is Gift Aid?
              </div>
              <div className="leading-7">
                Gift Aid is a UK government scheme that allows charities to
                reclaim the basic rate of tax on donations made by taxpayers,
                increasing the value of the donation at no extra cost to the
                donor.

                  How Does Gift Aid work?
                </div>
                <div className="leading-7">
                  When a taxpayer makes a donation, the charity can reclaim 25p
                  for every Â£1 donated, boosting the donation by 25%.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Individuals in the UK who are taxpayers and have paid
                  sufficient income or capital gains tax to cover the amount
                  reclaimed by the charity, as well as any tax relief received,
                  can claim Gift Aid. In short, the charity can only reclaim tax
                  money which you have paid.

                Some Assumptions Made When Determining Gift Aid Eligibility...
              </div>
              <div className="max-w-[50rem] leading-7">
                For simplicity the following was not considered when determining
                gift aid eligibility:
                <ul className="list-inside list-disc">
                  <li className=" leading-7">
                    Capital gains or dividends tax Tax relief.
                  </li>
                  <li className=" leading-7">
                    Job expenses tax relief that landlords can claim.
                  </li>
                  <li className=" leading-7">
                    Tax relief when paying back certain types of loans.

                </ul>
                <br />
                These were not considered as they either apply to a small
                minority of tax payers, or have little effect on the amount you
                can donate and claim gift aid.
